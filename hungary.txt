kyrgyz and hungarian relations have been a somewhat neglected area of our system of foreign relations
for us the importance of a country is not only determined by its population the size of its territory or its gdp per capita but also by its cultural achievements
a long time ago the kyrgyz and hungarians were part of the same people
our fates were intertwined not only in the distant past but also more recently
the agreements signed today include the setting up of a kyrgyz and hungarian development fund worth fifty million dollars 
finance cooperation between two countries
today the greatest obstacle to experiencing in daily life the shared origins and friendship between our two nations is geographical distance 
if we want this feeling of kinship and relations between us to be part of daily life and not simply the privilege of diplomacy we must link the two countries with a direct air route 
we must establish a direct air route between bishkek and budapest
hungary provides seventy five state scholarships for kyrgyz students 
We’ve agreed to raise this number to one hundred and fifty
hungary will be given an opportunity to invest in certain sectors in kyrgyzstan the hungarian economy will take this opportunity and we will also appear in the kyrgyz economys market wherever we have the appropriate technology
the basic approach is still unchanged because they would like to manage the migration and not to stop the migrants 
nobody can step on the ground of the eu without having a permission to do so because their request for asylum is accepted
until that moment they have to stay out of the territory of the eu
we can only succeed when we are in alliance with one another and never when we turn against one another but when we are in alliance we will always succeed
if we fail to arrange this regions affairs then instead outsiders will organize them no country on its own however is capable of structuring this region that task requires at least four countries slovakia poland, the czech republic and hungary
slovakia is our third most important foreign trade partner there are some eight hundred and forty slovak businesses operating in hungary and providing jobs for four thousand two hundred and twenty five people
hungary supports polands efforts with regard to belarus
democracy is important and human rights are important but demanding this will not be enough
strategic approach is needed
our interest that the entire economy of central europe continues to function 
we are making our countries and the whole region the most liveable in europe in other words we are eliminating the disadvantages we accumulated as a result of communism
at the time of the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic hungary was in a position to be able to offer help to those of its neighbours who were in most trouble we also helped Slovenians out slovenians are a grateful nation and they havent forgotten this
slovenian and hungarian relations is much better than at any time in the past
we will lay long-term foundations for Slovenian and hungarian cooperation which will remain strong and enduring regardless of the party family the governing parties or prime ministers of the day belong to
if hungary wants access to italian gas pipelines it can do so via slovenia this is another stalled programme our air transport links are rather rudimentary and the transformation of aviation is also in progress 
there is a hungarian national community living in slovenia and a slovenian national community living in hungar we cooperated well in this area with previous governments and now we have agreed to continue and extend these programmes so hungarians living in slovenia and slovenians living in hungary will live their lives with improved conditions in school systems cultural provision transport and opportunities for crossing the border
we must unhesitatingly admit serbia to the eu as soon as possible because without serbia europes security structure is not complete there is a gap in the system to give you a tangible example this is also where migrants are coming through so that is a country which should belong to europe and the eu
around the world we can see that the big boys and there are only two of them the Americans and the Chinese have overtaken us the eu which was once in the sphere of leading nations or leading organisations has been left behind this is because they have the military capacity which makes continuous scientific renewal possible the modern worlds greatest inventions these technological inventions and modern gadgets the internet gps, ipads  which determine the pace and development of the modern economy usually enter the civilian sphere from defence industry research
the notion that we would able to compete with the chinese and the americans through high tech research in the civilian sphere was widespread in europe ten years ago but that approach has failed 
we will not be able to rise to the same level as the great powers that determine the speed and direction of technology until there is a european army and a corresponding background research capacity in europe at present any aspirations in this regard are extremely rudimentary and require a european military force
why do not european goods sell well because their standards are not as high as they once were or because the standards of our competitors products are higher because the prices we charge for them are too high our taxes are too high and bureaucracy abounds so the european economy must be streamlined to make it competitive with the countries that are increasingly catching up with us or are even overtaking us
the good news is that an economic success story is promised by the whole of the central european economy the entire v4 with slovenia and croatia around them under the leadership of the polish  because the polish economy is the most robust in central europe
the leaders of the two countries are committing themselves personally to slowly but surely bettering the lives of slovenes in hungary and hungarians living in slovenia this is good news we are making much better progress and we have found a smoother form of cooperation one built on mutual trust and national friendship with the present government
eus emergency financial plan is not needed because of us so I would like to emphasize that a new additional european financial plan is not needed because of us this plan is needed because there are countries in the eu that are unable to keep their state debt under control and are mired in debt the question is whether we can help those countries and although hungary is instinctively opposed to collective borrowing we see that there are countries that need help now and so we accept the eus approach on joint borrowing
we need an intelligent financial alliance between the nation states between the member states of the eu
I personally support president trump in america because he is the only one I see as being able to put the american economy on track after the pandemic so these are just the sort of leaders we need right now and this is what we have got here in v4 now
we live down there in the south on the border for migration and we see what is happening and we see migration pressure intensifying day by day we need to catch an increasing number of illegal people smugglers at our border fences the number of illegal entry attempts is growing day by day and the incidence of epidemic disease on the migration route is also continuously increasing so I see that in the year ahead our task will now be to overcome the pandemic then relaunch the economy and then deal with increased migration pressure 
slovakia is hungarys third most important trading partner we are used to looking to the germans the austrians and america but the truth is that our third most important trading partner is slovakia last year the volume of trade between the two countries exceeded euro ten billion which is a very serious matter and a significant amount by international comparison 
we would like them to be able to create investments in hungary together with hungarians or even independently we have therefore opened a euro six hundred million credit line with eximbank which we can increase if necessary
I attach geostrategic importance to the volume of gas transported through existing slovak and hungarian gas pipelines and to a significant expansion an approximate tripling of the interconnector system these are developments which determine not only the security of the two countries but that of the entire region
we support the eus eastern partnership strategy in which belarus is a participant 
this strategy cannot be built with sanctions and so hungary represents the position that the eu should finally lift its sanctions against belarus
economic and trade cooperation between the eu and the eurasian economic union is in europes interest 
the minsk protocol is the only hope for a settlement of the situation in ukraine 
we have confirmed our agreement that belarus plays an important role in the energy security of our country of hungaary all hungarys oil imports are carried by a pipeline passing through your country
hungary have opened a credit line of euro forty million at eximbank to finance cooperation between belarusian and hungarian companies we are proud that a large hungarian company bábolna plays a major role in your food industry
I would also like to inform you that half of hungarian exports to your country are pharmaceutical products which is proof of the hungarian economys high level of technological development we also welcome the fact that wizzair will soon start running flights between our two capital cities
hungary supports belarus accession to the world trade organization and that we also support the signing of a belarus and nato security agreement
and finally nuclear energy represents a separate major area for cooperation between our two peoples and our two governments we reject the discriminatory approach to nuclear energy our two countries have decided to establish close engineering and technical cooperation in this field We are closely observing developments at your power plant in astravets which will start power generation soon because the paks two nuclear power plant under construction in hungary is being built with similar technology
hungary awards hungarian state scholarships to fifty belarusian students 
hungary is committed to supporting serbias european integration efforts we expect the institutions in brussels to open the six negotiating chapters that serbia is ready to open 
hungary will support serbian investment in hungary and I am pleased to report that there are such serbian investments in hungary
our eximbank has opened a credit line of euro one hundred million so that we can support cooperation between serbian and hungarian companies I see that construction of the rail link between budapest and belgrade has also entered a phase of more rapid progress 
everyone could see that bringing chinese goods into europe would be one of the key questions in the future and that this rail line would help to accelerate this we will also see the construction of a joint gas pipeline enabling hungary to receive some of its gas from you the serbs from the territory of serbia
we are convinced that a strong healthy dynamically developing serbia is a fundamental interest for hungary
our two countries have decided to launch a direct service a direct air route between chișinau and budapest our two capital cities by the autumn we must have a direct air connection between our two capitals because without this due to the great distance everything we say about economic cooperation is just hot air or a dead letter
in just forty days we have had to respond to more than five thousand illegal entry attempts some of these were not by lone individuals but by organized groups some even managed to break through and advance a few meters while others lined up at the border but we did not open the border and so they could not get in we expect this trend to intensify with increasing numbers and an increasing level of organization as the weather improves more and more of them will come currently potentially as many as one hundred thouasand migrants want to enter europe
I would like the slovak people to know that here we are defending not only the border of hungary but also the border of slovakia 
every year german and hungarian trade has reached new peaks the figure for two thousand nineteen will exceed fifty five billion euros 
as far as enlargement is concerned you know that hungary is a spokesman for enlargement of course now everyone is talking about macedonia and albania which is justified understandable and right but I will draw the chancellors attention to the fact that the key country in relation to the integration of the entire western balkans is serbia the serbian negotiations negotiations with the serbs must be accelerated as soon as possible and taken to their final stage because only their accession can guarantee the stability of the western balkans
national identity is a precondition of national conservatism and any success if I understand correctly the intention of politics I am not arguing in favor of china I am not arguing in favor of russia I am not arguing in favor of turkey but they are success stories in their own way and look at them how they are managed there are different recipes how to do it but all of them first started to restrengthen their national identity without having a strong national identity you simply cannot be successful in the modern age
even if you are in opposition you have to serve the nation because the nation is something above you okay I am not an expert in america but if I understand american politics correctly many people hate donald trump and love their own nation and I think it is getting more and more legitimate in hungary probably there are some people who hate me more than how much they like the nation but it is illegitimate to say it Because somehow the standard is that loving the nation is a must to serve the nation is a must because what else could be more important if you were born as a hungarian
we are accused of being populists and when I was young twenty years ago populism had a very clear meaning that if a politician promises something but is not able to deliver that is populism but if a politician promises something and then delivers it is not populism it is democracy 
first in two thousand eight during the financial crisis in europe liberal governments failed they were not able to regulate their economy in a proper way and they were not able to defend their own economy against the crisis
in two thousand fifteen the liberal governments failed a second time which was the migration crisis and the liberal governments failed to protect their own citizens they failed to protect their own borders and the security of their own citizens and stop illegal migration so it means that liberal governments failed liberal democracy in that sense is over 
I would like to mention that the reason why we think that christian democracy is a good description for us is that the universal catholic approach is the only one  I am a calvinist anyway the only one which appreciates and accepts national sovereignty 
it is a global idea but considers sovereign states valuable that is the reason why in hungary where seventy five percent are catholic and twenty five percent are calvinists we are able to cooperate for national sovereignty on a christian democratic basis that creates a national unity for national sovereignty as we understand 
the economic growth rate of the eu is basically provided by central europe I think when I am speaking about the success of hungary certainly I am a little biased but I have to mention that all the other countries around us are very successful the slovaks do well the czechs excellently the polish are stronger than ever croats are catching up the serbs try to join the eu so what I represent here is not just a success story of a country but a success story of a region
ukraine cannot be considered as part of the central european success story because they are just fighting for their survival because of the different geopolitical situation
in hungary we have muslim migrants that amount to zero so we do not have any the hungarian situation is totally different from that of the western countries and the southern countries It is pure mathematics to understand to where the western countries will develop in terms of demography and composition of their societies it is obvious that they will create will develop or evolve a society which will be a composition of a big muslim community which is growing and a christian community which is decreasing. that is how the western countries will look like whether we like it or not
so the outcome in many countries is a society a new type of society consisting of a decreasing christian element and an increasing muslim element the liberals support that process because the liberals think it is good they do not like christian society they do not like the identity as we understand societies so they think that the new composition of western societies would provide a nicer life a better life than it was during the so called christian europe
in central europe we have a different approach we do not know whether they are right or not probably their life and their society will be happier as a mixed society probably but we would not like to take the risk  
migration is bad because it is a real danger but on the other side it generated disputes which provided a chance for us to explain who we are and raise the question that without defining who we are again we cannot be successful and competitive with those nations as I mentioned who are just strengthening their own national identity
majority means that you have a majority of the opinion of the people and the migration issue is a good cause for christian democrats and national conservatives to explain again to the people what is at stake what is really important and how we imagine the future
budget includes injustices such as brussels continuing the bad practice of the past seven years whereby poorer countries share of the funding distributed from brussels is only five per cent even though our countries account for twenty per cent of europes population 
we must provide the budget with equitable foundations we want a fair budget and if this is achieved then within it the hungarians will find the arithmetic the combination of figures that is favorable to us
I have just come back from portugal where we held talks with sixteen other member states who have similar problems with the conceptual intellectual and theoretical foundations of the budget
overall the european economys competitiveness has fallen in global terms and we must pay the price for this
the withdrawal of the british and the fact that everyone in the uk is still alive today indicates that there is also life outside the eu
the european economy has been losing its competitiveness in recent years as a result of mistaken economic policy conducted from brussels no tax reduction no reduction of bureaucracy no decisions in favor of improving competitiveness just the opposite to limit the competitiveness even inside of eu we will pay the price of that in the global markets 
we are not able to create a fair and better budget as we have had in the previous seven years we cannot accelerate economic growth in the eu consequently we cannot help our citizens to have better living conditions
we have to first clarify how to get back the ability to compete with the outside world
we need a budget which provides as much flexibility as possible for the member states to encourage those countries who are ready to decrease taxation I think flexibility and decreasing taxes that is the main line 
rather than isolating ourselves we in the v4 seek cooperation with europes other countries my feeling that austria is a natural partner of hungary and the v4 was strengthened and I also saw that austria will remain an important country for central europe as an investor as a market and as a trade partner
 in the future austria will be a key security partner of ours because on the issue of migration we are in the same boat
if migrants break through via hungary they will arrive in austria and then they will either stay there or move on to germany so I am convinced that austria continues to have an interest in the successful defence of hungarys southern borders I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for the help we received when austrian border guards came to hungarys southern border to assist in border defense 
we should also invite the western balkan countries aiming to join the eu regardless of the fact that they are not yet members of the eu the issue of the future of europe also affects them
the fact of the matter is that missile attacks have struck military bases occupied by american military personnel hungarian soldiers are also stationed at one of these bases not a single hungarian soldier has been injured 
we decided to send over a senior military leader who has since arrived and taken command of the troops there the minister informed us that all conditions are in place for the immediate evacuation of hungarian soldiers should that prove to be necessary the means needed for such an airborne evacuation are already in place
the question is whether or not we should withdraw in essence we see this as being conditional on an intergovernmental agreement the international legal grounds and I think also perhaps the domestic legal grounds for the deployment of hungarian soldiers in iraq is that the hungarian government has entered into an agreement with the iraqi government on our soldiers being able to be based there and yesterday we decided that we shall continue to fulfil our treaty obligations until such time as the iraqis terminate the agreement if the iraqi government terminates the agreement we will immediately evacuate the hungarian soldiers 
we looked at what has been happening in turkey the turkish immigration directorates annual summary states that four hundred fifty thousand people entered turkey illegally in two thousand nineteen this was an increase of seventy percent on the previous year accordingly or as a consequence compared with the previous year there has also been a dramatic increase one hundred and eighty percent in the number of migrants heading for Greece the logical consequence of this has been an increase in the number of migrants on the balkan route
consequently more and more people are heading due north towards the hungarian and serbian border As a result migration pressures at the hungarian border have increased significantly 
we have also had to deal with this issue because last week the number of attempts to cross the border illegally exceeded one hundred per day so every day we need to intercept more than one hundred people crossing the border illegally we need to intercept them detain them and then transport them back the police need to eject them as it were to open the gates of the transit zone enabling them to return to Serbia in order to do this work we need to increase the number of soldiers and police officers serving on the serbian and hungarian border and yesterday we decided to send further units to the border and deploy further police officers to the area We have activated the border defense agreement concluded among the v4 countries so the czech republic poland and slovakia will be able to provide us with immediate assistance if needed and we decided to provide immediate assistance to macedonia and arranged for a police contingent to be sent to that country
the total investment sum for this is one thousand seven hundred billion forints I only mention this because it is the highest level of investment ever made in hungary 
last year thirty eight percent of new jobs in hungary were linked to investments originating in asia so in two thousand nineteen thirty eight percent of new jobs in hungary were created by investments that came to this country from china korea and japan I said that I consider this to be a vindication because clearly the publicly declared policy of  eastward opening is coming to fruition with investments made in hungary incidentally in two thousand nineteen the largest investors in hungary were the koreans
as regards climate protection yesterday the government discussed the countrys climate strategy together with its energy strategy this is because in minister palkovics view these two issues can only be dealt with together
we were introduced to the climate change action plan presented to us by the minister and we adopted it
we also adopted the new national energy strategy and the new national energy and climate protection plan 
we know of twenty one countries in the world which have been able to produce significant economic growth while also reducing their carbon dioxide emissions there are twenty one such countries out of the worlds two hundred and hungary is one of these twenty one countries.
comparing the european states in terms of their climate protection performance we can say that hungary is in the top third 
we have carried out the necessary calculation and we can state that hungary could be converted into a country with a climate neutral economy by two thousand fifty but this would cost fifty thousand billion forints this shows that climate protection is extremely important but also extremely expensive it is possible and it is worth it but this is the amount of money we must raise 
we must openly state that in europe we cannot build a climate neutral economy without nuclear energy and the use of nuclear energy should be supported not restricted 
the growth center of the whole of the eu is shifting to the east to central europe for a long time now we have no longer been talking about the german and french axis in the eu western europes relationship with the countries of central europe is at least as important as the german and french relationship so the whole region is in the process of upgrading and when a region is upgraded large and strong countries try to gain influence there and so the important countries and regions also become the scene of geopolitical matches 
it is not used to talk about it in public but the truth is that today central europe is also the scene of geopolitical matches precisely because of its appreciation we can identify russian german american turkish steps to influence we must take this as a natural thing it is not a problem but a good sign it is a question of this region becoming important and being upgraded 
we all know that in central europe but perhaps across the continent in geopolitical matches energy policy is a special medium and terrain
so if we connect the systems of the power lines of the two countries today or start the necessary investment then we are basically strengthening our position in the geopolitical matches
if in the future it were possible to reach agreement on the significant strengthening and interconnection of the gas pipeline network between slovenia and hungary it would also have geopolitical significance and I hope that the two governments will then be able to agree on this if we could significantly increase rail links between the two countries between slovenia and hungary then we also have geopolitical significance and it leads us to the fact that this can increase the independence the sovereignty of the two countries and that we can become more protected from geopolitical matches we will be better able to assert our own interests It is therefore my conviction that what is happening here now is a common interest a slovenian and hungarian interest and at the same time central european interest
for the Hungarians this is an important investment for one more reason today the price of electricity and gas is a particular political issue in hungary which is what we call the policy of reducing ancillary costs at home and in two thousand ten when I returned to government hungary paid the seventeenth highest price for electricity in the european ranking the sixteenth for the gas today gas is the cheapest in europe in hungary and electricity is the second cheapest for private consumers 
it is therefore an important matter for us that our energy system is in order and flexible connected to others and that there are no disturbances in operation that increase the price of electricity because the hungarians have already become accustomed to households receiving energy as cheaply as possible
